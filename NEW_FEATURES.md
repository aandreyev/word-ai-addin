- **Suggestion details** with full JSON structure
- **Application results** and success metrics
- **Session metadata** with timestamps and statistics

### 2. 🔄 **Actual Content Modification**

- **Custom content** - Generates content based on AI instructions

#### **Delete Actions:**
- **Smart deletion handling** - Marks content for deletion with reasoning
- **Contextual notes** - Explains why deletion is suggested
- **Visual indicators** - Strike-through formatting with explanatory notes

### 3. 💾 **Session Management**
- **Automatic saving** to browser localStorage
- **Session retrieval** - View any past analysis
- **Session listing** - Browse all saved sessions
- **Persistent logs** - Analysis data survives browser restarts

## 🚀 How to Test the New Features

### **Step 1: Run Analysis**
1. **Type some sample text** in Word (try various paragraph lengths and styles)
2. **Click "Analyze Document"** in the add-in
3. **Watch the enhanced console output** showing the complete analysis process

### **Step 2: Apply Changes**
1. **Click "Apply Suggestions"** 
2. **Watch your document content actually change** (not just notes added)
3. **See visual indicators** (✨ for modifications, strike-through for deletions)

### **Step 3: View Analysis Report**
1. **Check the console** for the complete markdown report
2. **Use browser localStorage** to view saved sessions:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   window.aiDocumentReviewService.showSavedSessions()
   window.aiDocumentReviewService.loadSession('session-id')
   ```

## 📋 Example Test Document

Try this sample text to see all features in action:

```
This is a very long and complicated sentence that was written in a way that makes it difficult for readers to understand and follow the main point being made. The document was analyzed by the system and improvements were suggested by the artificial intelligence model. There are several issues that need to be addressed. This paragraph is much shorter and should be fine.
```

**Expected AI Actions:**
- **Paragraph 1**: Break long sentence + improve passive voice
- **Paragraph 2**: Convert passive voice to active  
- **Paragraph 3**: May suggest expansion or connection
- **Paragraph 4**: Likely no changes needed
