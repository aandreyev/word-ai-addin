This folder contains consolidated documentation for the Word AI Add-in project. The top-level README and other root markdown files were copied here and cleaned so links and references resolve locally.

Quick links

- Overview: ./index.md
- Quick API reference: ./API_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Doppler setup: ./DOPPLER_SETUP.md
- API infrastructure: ./API_INFRASTRUCTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Development guide: ./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md

If you need the original copies, the repository root contains backups with the `.orig` suffix (for example `README.md.orig`).

Status

- Development environment: ready
- Doppler secret injection: verified
- Dev server (local): runs on port 3000; log server on 3001

How to run the add-in locally (short)

1. From the `addin-project` folder, build and run the dev server under Doppler so the API key is injected at build time:

	doppler run --project mswordai --config dev -- npm --prefix ./addin-project run dev

2. Sideloaded add-in will open in Word. Watch the dev server console for `REAL API MODE` messages.

Notes

- Webpack injects `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` at build time. Start the dev server under Doppler so the compiled bundle contains the real key.
- A token-budget guard and configurable paragraph limit are implemented in the AI service to avoid sending excessively large prompts.
